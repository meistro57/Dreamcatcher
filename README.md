# Dreamcatcher

*"Catch it. Grow it. Build it. From spark to systemâ€”without losing a beat."*

An AI-powered idea factory that captures, analyzes, and evolves your thoughts into reality. Built for neurodivergent creators who think faster than they can remember.

## Why Dreamcatcher Exists

Because it took me three tries just to get this idea to the AI who's going to build it for me. And by the third try, I almost forgot it. So I built a system that never forgets, never sleeps, and thinks about my ideas harder than I do.

## Core Concept

A 24/7 self-hosted system that:
- **Captures raw creative energy** the moment it strikes
- **Uses AI agents** to refine, connect, and expand ideas
- **Generates visuals** through enhanced ComfyUI integration
- **Writes proposals** and builds prototypes automatically
- **Continuously improves itself** using autonomous evolution system
- **Never loses an idea** with comprehensive tracking and recovery
- **Adapts and learns** from your creative patterns

## ðŸš€ New Features & Improvements

### Recently Added:
- âœ… **Enhanced AI Service** with fallback models and retry logic
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing Framework** with 90%+ coverage
- âœ… **Advanced ComfyUI Integration** with WebSocket monitoring
- âœ… **Complete API Coverage** for all system functionality
- âœ… **Robust Error Handling** throughout the entire system
- âœ… **Agent Communication System** with proper message routing
- âœ… **Production-Ready Monitoring** with detailed metrics
- âœ… **Autonomous Evolution System** for continuous improvement
- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline** with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- âœ… **Multi-User Authentication** with JWT-based security and user management
- âœ… **Comprehensive Documentation** with complete CLAUDE.md for future development
